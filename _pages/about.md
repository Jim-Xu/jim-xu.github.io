Hi, I am Xiaotian Xu, a fifth-year Ph.D. Student at Department of Climate, Meteorology & Atmospheric Sciences, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), under supervision of Prof. [Nicole Riemer](https://www.atmos.illinois.edu/~nriemer/index.html). Before that, I worked as a full-time research assistant in Prof. [Yanxu Zhang](https://ebmg.tulane.edu)â€™s group in School of Atmospheric Science at Nanjing university (NJU) from Dec. 2019 to Jun. 2021. I received my M.S. degree in Environmental Science and Management at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (HKUST) in Nov 2019, for thesis conducted in the Atmospheric Chemistry Group of Prof. [Jianzhen Yu](https://landsea.ust.hk/~chjianyu/). and B.Eng. degree in Environmental Engineering at Shanxi University (SXU) in 2018.
